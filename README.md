Won't play this morality game
Won't play this morality game

Little secrets stowed inside in disarray
No, sir, no, sir, yeah, I'm on to you-ooh
Constant judgement, like you're made of solid gold
So prudent, the truth is you're no better
 
And really you take desperate measures
Tuck away the shame and shift the blame
Give it up, getting stuck in a cage
I can't say the same

I like it, I like it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
You're better? No better, I've seen all your hidden folders
Don't even try it, you can't explain
Just quit it, quit it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
Oh, devil, be careful, you're gonna fall right into it
So pathetic, don't ya think?

Such an angel, surely, no, you'd never do a bad thing
How strange, found a little clue-ooh
Your hands, red, stained, paint but looks a lot like blood
Caught ya, caught ya, what will you do?

Oh, you're the purest, the only one
Who's never ever done a damn thing wrong
Be so real, can't conceal
All the shame that lives in your heart

I like it, I like it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
You're better? No better, I've seen all your hidden folders
Don't even try it, you can't explain
Just quit it, quit it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
Oh, devil, be careful, you're gonna fall right into it
So pathetic, don't ya think?

Won't play this morality game
Won't play this morality game

When you speak, like the second coming of God
How does it feel to break all your rules and then yell them so loud?
I'm really not a bad girl, well, maybe in your world
Honest, I don't care
Hypocrisy, you're just like me
Soon your halo will fall

I like it, I like it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
You're better? No better, I've seen all your hidden folders
Don't even try it, you can't explain
Just quit it, quit it, did I say something
That didn't quite fit into your morality game?
Oh, devil, be careful, you're gonna fall right into it
So pathetic, don't ya think?
To you morality is just a stupid game
